# united
An experimental atomic css prototype framework, developed for prototyping patterns for cloud.gov. (See [cloud.gov style](https://github.com/18F/cg-style) and the [cloud.gov pattern library](https://styleguide.fr.cloud.gov/))

## What it does
United is an _experimental_ atomic css utility class framework (similar to [Basscss](http://basscss.com/), [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/), or [Solid](http://solid.buzzfeed.com/)) that allows designing for a wide expressive gamut without modifying css. Utility classes are single-use immutable classes that can be chained together to create more sophisticated presentational styles.

## What problem this solves
Among other things, a utility class framework can be helpful to prototype new patterns in a pattern library without modifying production code. It allows a designer or developer to get into design with minimal classing/naming overhead, and can provide tight integration with Sketch files built with similar base principles.

Utility classes can form a universal language shared between different traditional taxonomic systems, as well as a bridge between visual design and front-end design — potentially making it simpler to move from design to production.

## Developing locally
